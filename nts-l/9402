extended features of Textures

Consulting five TeX implementations as to whether
restrictions 1. and 2. hold as stated, I find:

   Textures | OzTeX | Direct-TeX | mlTeX | C-TeX
1.   no       yes       yes         yes      yes
2.   no       no        no          no       no

I conclude that Bernd's correction to 2 is sustained
for standard TeX; and that my "correction" to 1.
is not --- as Peter Breitenlohner predicted.
I am very happy to be wrong here rather than in TUGboat.

   I was accurately describing *extended TeX* behavior
of Textures --- a subject certainly of interest here.

    I am surprised.  Hitherto I had not found any qualitative
deviation of Textures behavior from that of an enormous initex
with which one communicates mostly via Macintosh interface
tools.

    Has anyone else noticed further "extended" TeX features
of Textures? The obvious answer is that Textures has merged
initex into virtex.  But has it not just dropped
virtex?

    Extended TeXs aught to provide a complete catalog of their
deviations from the performance of standard TeX. (That
includes e-TeX.) Particularly so where ".tex" file
acceptabilityis involved.  Has Textures not done so?

If you want e-TeX users to be numerous, tell them that they
will be able to use as many modules of e-TeX as their
power and capacity and os permit.  And that, in TeX
compatibility mode, power and RAM requirements will be
comparable to that of TeX.

Lessons from the past


1)  Textures has already erased the distinction between initex and
virtex. I hope e-TeX will do as much.

2)  Textures has already allowed pattern assimilation by
any format of TeX that does not contain a compacted hyphenation trie.
I hope e-TeX will do as much.  This allows one to quickly
(inter)nationalize precompiled formats.

3)  (ini)TeX 2 allowed one to erase the existing trie at any
time and input new patterns. I hope e-teX will do as much.
Even if it cannot be done on a language-by-language basis.
No new command is needed;  TeX could simply report that it
has been obliged to erase patterns.  Textures does not
currently have this feature.

    With (3), e-TeX could never be completely stopped
when a heavily multilingual job comes along --- say a
tourist brochure in seven languages.  At worst it would be
slowed.

    I see no reason why (1) and (2) would require one to

 > -- to remove the trie compaction in IniTeX,
 > -- change the code behind \pattern to build an already usable
trie

So this proposal not what Bernd is suggesting.  Are (1)(2)(3)
inadequate in practice?

For preprocessing patterns TeX needs a number of arrays size of which
can be astimated as
( 3*sizeof(int) + sizeof(char) +sizeof(boolean) ) * trie_size + 256*sizeof(int)

This gives about 120k for trie size of 30000.

We don't have to give up with compaction.  We can end up with partial
compaction ie.  when dumping format eTeX can compact whatever it has
ready and then each set can be compacted before use.  In current TeX a
flag is checked whether the table has already been compacted befor
typesetting is started.  It can be arranged that there is a separate
flag for each language.  It can be checked separately before
hyphenating word in current language and if this part of table is not
ready it can be compacted.

I have made test to see what is the overlap between the subtries of
Polish and English patterns.  Here are the results.
English patterns   6075 trie size as reported by iniTeX
Polish patterns    5505
      ------------------
       total      11580

When loading two sets together i get trie size 11344.  That means the
gain from compacting patterns together is 236 at the level of 2% !!!.
(Can anybody check this for other sets of paterns ?)

At the same time Ziri Zlatuska's experiments show that compacted
patterns are nearly 30% smaller than non compacted.

Travel to Warwick University
There is an Inter-City rail service to Coventry, but from some
locations it may be easier to travel to Birmingham initially.

Bristol (TM) to B'ham        0714    0854  Trains from Birmingham to Coventry
                             0830    0954  are frequent and fast (journey time
Newcastle to B'ham           0640    0951  of 20--30 minutes, departing
York to B'ham                0742    0951  every 10 or 15 minutes).

There will be a shuttle bus service running between 1000 and 1030 for delegates
arriving at Coventry Railway Station. The shuttle bus will also be available
on the 22nd to take delegates back to the station.

A taxi from the station to the University costs about \pounds4.
Alternatively, buses (notably the X10, X12, 12 and 12A) run from
just outside the station to the University, taking about 15 minutes.
It is a de-regulated service and as such impossible to guess the
fare from day to day. It is usually about 50p. The 12 and 12A services
are `correct fare only', but no-one (except the driver) knows what
the correct fare is.

The University is easily accessible by car, and
may be reached from the M1, M40, M42, M45, M6 and M69.
There is ample parking for private vehicles on campus.

Birmingham airport is about 12 minutes from Coventry by
rail and is connected by a frequent and fast service.

Subject:      Another debugging proposal

Proposed debugging extension:

---Improve the reporting of conditionals when \tracingmacros > 1 to make
it easier to locate the source of an error such as "File ended when \ifx
on line 1371 was incomplete". Since TeX already maintains the
information about the begin-conditional command and the line number, I
hope that it would not be too hard to write this into the log file at
the appropriate point, together with the current conditional nesting
level:

  {\ifx: 2 l.300}
  {false}
  {\fi: \ifx 2 l.300}

where "2" indicates the nesting level inside the conditional.

Motivation: There is currently no easy way to properly match up all the
\if's and \fi's in a tracing log, for reasons that are a little
complicated to explain. Anyone who has tried to debug this sort of error
in a complicated macro package will know what I'm talking about, I
think. The proposed extension would help in this way: If you want to
find the \ifx that matches a given \fi, you would merely have to search
backward for the pattern

  {\ifx: 2

The nesting level number guarantees that the first occurrence in the
reverse direction will be the proper match, provided that tracing was
turned on throughout the intervening material. The line number will help
track down a match when there is a large amount of intervening material
so that tracing through all of it would be inconvenient (for example, by
producing a log file that uses up all 7 megs of your remaining disk
space :-).
