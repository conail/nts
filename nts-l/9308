Wanted new primitve: \currentinteractionmode

In `Around the bent #8' (by MJD), \batchmode was used to suppress some
very annoying and misleading error messages and switched off afterwards by
\errorstopmode to show a wanted error message. However, this solution assumes,
that the whole file is executed in errorstopmode, since there is no
possibility to return to the original mode. However, this deficiency of TeX
could be easily cured by a new primitive,
\currentinteractionmode,
which returns the current interaction mode. A construction like:
\let\savedmode\currentinteractionmode
\batchmode
.....
\savedmode
would become possible than.

Yours, J"org Knappen.

P.S. In the same thread MJD watched the non-presence of an \afterfi
primitive working analogously to \aftergroup; but I'm not clear about the
implications of an \afterfi.

There are other useful primitives missing in TeX...

Sometimes I have wished that there's a possibility to inquire the
current mode of the TeX's mouth/gullet/stomach operation.

E.g. I have wanted a conditional or primitive to signal, when TeX is
in "expand only" mode (\edef, \mark, \write, ...), when TeX is
scanning numbers (here I'm thinking---and hating---german.sty's active
doublequote, which can also be used as a marker for hexadecimal
numbers), when TeX is peeking for some special tokens (first column in
an \halign), etc...



My ideas about Joerg's \currentinteractionmode:

Implement \currentinteractionmode as a normal integer register and
assign numerical values to the different modes.  Then it is possible
to group the mode (no need to save the current mode) and the current
primitives can be implemented as global assignments to this register.
(Very simple to implement, only small changes in tex.web needed.)

I think that he compares \if...\fi with a group {...} and he want's to
use something like \if ...\afterfi\foo ...\fi which inserts the cs
\foo after the "closing" \fi token.  (IMHO the \afterfi should be
expandable, because \if...\fi is expandable.)  Perhaps an \afterfi can
simplify some obscure mouth-only macros with nested conditionals???
