WHAT SUPPORT FOR NTS?

    Such is the complexity of TeX that it is not clear that it
can be made to progress a great deal further in a cost-effective
way. That is one of the many reasons I hesitate to back the idea
of straight-away seeking major financing for NTS.  Dick Palais's
confidence gathering approach making first small steps seems just the
right thing.

    On the other hand I have a feeling that the honours showered on
Knuth since the completion of Computers and Typesetting can be
taken as a sign that the world of science wholly approves of Knuth
having done practical programming rather than (say) quietly going
on to write volumes 4--7 of the Art of Computer Programming. For
those of us who feel TeX-Metafont is the great music, it is satisfying
to hear the mighty applause.

    Further, TeX is likely to be one of the major computer languages
of science for the forseeable future, and perhaps the most widely used
of all. Surely then proposals to undertake work along this line will
get a fair hearing in the scientific world along side of more
theoretical projects.

    In Knuth's programming, the solidity, performance, and
documentation give an inspiring example and a tough standard.  His
style and standards fit perfectly into the traditional university
model of science.

     Yes, that is little science, not the big science spawned by the
Los Almos project and its many sequels. For me, that means that most
actors are autonomous and individually responsible scientists whose
research is in or related to the NTS project --- rather than (say)
administrators or project employees with collective responsibility. I
occasionally get the feeling that some NTS enthousiasts would like to
see a NTS project make it BIG.  I presently hope that little science
would prove a welcoming and adequate context for NTS --- but explicit
debate is just beginning.

I will be out of town today through Thursday (8/6) hopefully
dominating noontime basketball at the UW SERF and getting
in a few racquetball victories as well. ( :^))
I will be reading my mail while in Wisconsin periodically.

I'm on vacation until August 21st.

In an emergency, you might reach me at 011-44-225-338076, which is my
parent's number in Bath, UK.

Otherwise, enjoy the weather.

Larry Siebenmann has asked me to forward this to NTS-L because his,
``current communications are currently verrry shaky''.  Sorry if it
gets posted twice.
