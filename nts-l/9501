Subject:      \eqno, \leqno should not be math mode

A suggestion for e-TeX:

The contents of \eqno, \leqno should be typeset in text mode, not math
mode. In particular, they should not call \everymath. Equation numbers
are inherently textual in nature, like all the other structural
numbering in a document, even though we sometimes embellish them with
bits of math or want to use centered math * instead of raised text *.

Many thanks for your suggestion, Michael: I will ensure that it
is discussed.  ** Phil.
