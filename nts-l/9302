Subject:      nts - is anything happening



Is anything happening in the NTS world? I have not got a record of any
mail in this list for ages.

1) Are the people on this list still interested in successors to TeX?

2) Has DANTE progressed any further with the setting up of a project
   to develop such a system, other than setting up this list?

Just asking!

David

You are quite correct; this list _has_ been quiet of late, but things
have been happening in the background...

Most definitely!

Not yet a project per se, but this will undoubtedly be discussed at
the Dante '93 meeting at Chemnitz in March which I very much hope to
attend.

>>> Just asking!

Without wishing to in any sense jump the gun, I think I can say with some
confidence that there will shortly be some announcements on this list;
Joachim Lammarsch is unwell at the moment, and Rainer is very tied up
with other (equally important) matters such as LaTeX-3, NFSS-2, and
earning a living!  However, we are working towards some way of reducing
the load on Rainer, and I confidently expect there to be renewed activity
before long.
