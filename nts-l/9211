Subject:      Break-Algorithmn


I'm new in NTS, but it seems to me, that the discussion ist to "atomistic" (or
I'm member of the wrong discussion??).
During a professional layout-project I think I've met some traps of TeX.
My suggestions:
A noninteractive system must be almost perfect in breaking lines and pages,
especially in multicolumn-output, because it ist troublesome to change ugly
pieces of text by hand. I have noted a long list of wishes, in which most
items affects pagebreaks and vertical spacing (and hyphenation, but perfect
hypenation in the german language will stay an impossible thing).
For pagebreaking: isn't it possible, like TeX paragraph-breaking,
to hold a buffer of text and delay the final break until a hard pagebreak
is reached, for example at a the begin of a chapter?
In my opinion, the most important matter is a transparent (!) (not penalty
here and demerit there and obsession somewhere) high-level typesetting
language, where I can say exactly what I want and which priority my wishes
shall own. There are many impossible wishes, of course, but a clearly set
of rules and requests can be observed, I'm sure.
